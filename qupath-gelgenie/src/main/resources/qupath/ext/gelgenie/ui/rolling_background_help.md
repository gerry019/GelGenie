### Rolling-Ball Background Correction

This background correction method works by calculating the background for the entire image using ImageJ's implementation of the 'rolling ball' algorithm.  More details can be found here: https://imagej.net/ij/docs/menus/process.html#background.

The rolling ball radius can be user-defined but otherwise the method will run automatically (no additional user input is required).
