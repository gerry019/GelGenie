### Auto-Register and Auto-Label

To expedite your workflow, instead of manually registering and labelling each band, you can alternatively use the auto buttons in this row:

- Auto-Register: This button will automatically grab all 'undefined' annotations and convert them all into gel bands.  You might need to click on your image one more time for it to update the colours to orange.
- Auto-Label:  This will attempt to automatically assign all bands a label in the format LX-Y where X = lane number and Y = band number.  It will assign lanes/bands from the top left of the image and progress to the far right corner of the image.  If your image is not vertically oriented, you will need to rotate it to a vertical orientation for this to work properly (currently).
